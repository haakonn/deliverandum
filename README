This is Deliverandum 0.9, a web application to manage delivery of exercises
in an educational setting.

It is written in Java using Spring 3.0.

This version is rough around the edges. It does not have a standards-based
authentication mechanism yet; the current one is designed for a proprietary
user management system. Spring Security support is planned to mend this
for version 1.0.

In addition, graphics and CSS is missing. We were unable to include these
for copyright reasons. Free replacements for these are planned for 1.0.
We would be thankful for contributions especially in this area.

Requirements include a Servlet container (Tomcat has been tested) and a
JDBC-supported DBMS (PostgreSQL has been tested). The application has been
run in a production environment under Ubuntu Server 9.10.

The software has been developed for the Department of Informatics at the
University of Bergen, Norway. It has been licensed under the Affero
GNU General Public License, version 3.0. This means you can freely use
it for your own purposes; however, if you make modifications, you are
required to make those modifications available to users of your installation
under the same license as was granted you. We gladly accept patches!

Please contact me, Haakon Nilsen <haakon@ii.uib.no> if you have any questions
or comments. I would love to hear how you make use of the software.
